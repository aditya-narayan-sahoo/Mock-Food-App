# Mock React Food Ordering App

## Overview

This is a mock food ordering application built using React, uses normal CSS and Tailwind for styling, uses Parcel to bundle, and uses Context API and Redux Toolkit for state management. The application allows users to search for restaurants, filter them by rating, and manage their cart by adding or removing items. The project incorporates Jest for testing and is inspired by the Namaste React course by Akshay Saini.

## Features

- **Restaurant Search**: Users can search for restaurants based on their preferences.
- **Filtering**: Restaurants can be filtered according to their ratings, making it easier to find the best options.
- **Cart Management**: Users can add items to their cart and remove them as needed, providing a seamless ordering experience.
- **State Management**: The application uses context API and Redux Toolkit for managing the application's state efficiently.

- **Testing**: Jest is utilized for writing tests to ensure the application's functionality and reliability.
